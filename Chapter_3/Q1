Complete the following program skeleton so it asks for the user’s weight (in
pounds) and displays the equivalent weight in kilograms.
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
 {
 double pounds, kilograms;
 // Write code here that prompts the user
 // to enter his or her weight and reads
 // the input into the pounds variable.
 // The following line does the conversion.
 kilograms = pounds / 2.2;
 // Write code here that displays the user's weight
 // in kilograms.
 return 0;
 } 
 
 Solution-
 
 #include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
 {
 double pounds, kilograms;
 cout << "Enter your weight in pounds:";cin >> pounds;
 // The following line does the conversion.
 // One kilogram weighs 2.2 pounds.
 kilograms = pounds / 2.2;
 cout << "Your weight is";
 cout << kilograms;
 return 0;
 }
